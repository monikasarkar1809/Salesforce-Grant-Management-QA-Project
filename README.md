🧩 Salesforce Grant Management QA Project

📘 Project Overview

This Salesforce QA project demonstrates a complete Grant Management System designed to track grant applications, disbursements, and funding programs.
The goal is to ensure end-to-end validation of Salesforce workflows, field relationships, and data integrity — from application submission to fund disbursement and performance tracking.

 📌 The project covers:

Custom Object creation and field validation

Lookup relationships (Parent–Child structure)

Report and Dashboard creation

Functional, UI, and workflow testing

Validation rule and data consistency checks

⚙️ Key Features Tested

✅ Custom object and field creation validation
✅ Lookup relationship testing (Grant → Disbursement → Funding Program)
✅ Validation Rules:

Amount Requested > 10

Disbursed Amount ≤ Requested Amount
✅ CRUD operations testing for all custom objects
✅ Reports and Dashboard verification
✅ Access control and field-level security check
✅ End-to-end data consistency validation


Dashboard: Grants Overview Dashboard

The dashboard provides a visual summary of all grant activities:

1️⃣ New Grant Applications Report → Donut Chart (by Status)
2️⃣ New Disbursements Report → Gauge (by Payment Status)
3️⃣ New Funding Programs Report → Bar Chart (by Total Budget)
